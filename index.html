<a id="current-project" class="anchor" href="#current-project" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Project</h1>

<p>My current project is to investigate computer vision using deep learning, and learn more about TensorFlow and Keras. I've set up an AWS free account and started reading the documentation to learn more about the service, and how to set things up.</p>

<p>A friend advised me to start with the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection">diabetic retinopathy detection</a> competition. Although the competition is closed, he advised me it's not difficult to get good results, but more difficult to get great results. I'm also interested in investigating <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08401">universal adversarial perturbation</a> and see if I can improve the results by expanding the number of images.</p>

<p>Another interesting blog post covers <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/compressing-and-regularizing-deep-neural-networks">compressing and regularizing deep neural networks</a>.</p>

<p>I'd also like to create a classifier which helps determine if an image is off-center or blurred. I suspect this kind of feature, fed to the deep learning network, could help with detection.</p>

<a id="aws-spot-termination-notices" class="anchor" href="#aws-spot-termination-notices" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AWS Spot Termination Notices</h1>

<p>Amazon now gives you a two minute warning for spot termination notices. Spot instances are only activated or run when the spot price falls below your pre-selected limit. When the spot price rises, the instance is terminated. Before the instance terminates, you need to save your results, log files, etc.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://blog.fugue.co/2015-01-06-spot-termination-notices.html">simple way</a> to detect the termination notice. However, I'd like to write a Python 3 module that would handle this in a graceful way, including <code>job lib.dump</code> on my model, save log files, record the record just used in the fit process, etc. That way, the instance could recover on its own and continue the neural network fit.</p>

<a id="python" class="anchor" href="#python" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Python</h1>

<p>I'm investigating logging in Python a bit further. I'm looking at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8467978/python-want-logging-with-log-rotation-and-compression">timed rotation log handlers with compression</a>. I'll add this to my <a href="https://github.com/dtsmith2001/python-learning-code">Python learning</a> repository.</p>

<p>I'm slowly working on my Linux and OS X dotfiles. This is a particular pain point for me, as I am tired of setting up dotfiles at new jobs. So check out <a href="https://github.com/dtsmith2001/configuration">my dotfiles</a>.</p>

</h2>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/transcranial/jupyter-themer">jupyter-themer</a> to make my notebooks more readable. In particular, I was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes" class="user-mention">@brandon-rhodes</a> style sheets found in his <a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon-pandas-tutorial">Pandas tutorial from PyCon 2015</a>. I prefer striped tables myself, so I looked around a bit. I don't know anything about CSS, but I did find a whole <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp">list of examples</a>. I made my own stylesheet using Brandon's and added the striped table example. jypyter-themer then copied the style sheet and I'm good to go. I sent a pull request to the maintainer for the <code>hover table</code> layout. You can how install this layout yourself. Beware, if you modify the CSS, you must reinstall jupyter-themer again before you can activate it.</p>

<p>One other thing I learned from <a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes" class="user-mention">@brandon-rhodes</a> talk was to use the plot method for DataFrame rather than matplotlib directly. Oh, and I also use seaboard with the ggplot2 theme in my Jupyter notebooks.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve read parts of this book (which is based on a series or blog posts), and learned a lot. I particularly like method chaining with automatic logging and the pipelines and categorically chapters. Oh, the <a href="https://github.com/TomAugspurger/modern-pandas">notebooks are available</a>.</p>

<p>I wish more authors would turn a series of blog posts into books!</p>

</h1>

<p>I've had occasion recently to debug API calls, and a colleague (thanks, Anna!) suggested I use Postman. Well, it's good. In fact, it's very good. And you can create test suites from your history to facilitate automated testing. The test suite also serves as a good collection of examples for documentation.</p>

<p>Nina Zumel wrote a series of blog posts on y-aware PCA and feature scaling. PCA does not take into account the predicted variable.</p>
